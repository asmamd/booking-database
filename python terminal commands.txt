python terminal commands:

for retrieve the data from database we need import flask framework for web application and import MySQL.connector for python database connectivity .
the commands are :

If you're using Python 3.12, you may want to explicitly use pip for that Python version:
1/ python -m pip install flask

Alternatively, if you have multiple Python installations, you can target the correct one like this:
C:/Users/asmam/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe -m pip install flask





1/ "pip install Flask" (make sure its similar version that is python using)

Verify Flask Installation: Once installed, you can verify that Flask was installed correctly by running:
pip show flask


2/  "pip install mysql-connector-python" for database connection
3/ you can see pip list for entire list of services by using "pip list" command
4/ for virtual environment or for web interface like browser try 
5/  Navigate to Your Project Directory:
First, make sure you're in the project directory where you want to set up the virtual environment. For example:
cd d:/bootcamp/javascript/portfolio/booking-database
6/ 2. Create the Virtual Environment:
To create a virtual environment, you can use the venv module (built into Python 3).

Run this command to create the virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
This will create a new folder named venv in your project directory, containing the virtual environment.

7/ Activate the Virtual Environment:
After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it.
.\venv\Scripts\activate

8/ Running Your Script in the Virtual Environment:
After activating the virtual environment, run your script as usual:
python app.py
9/ . Deactivate the Virtual Environment:
When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it:
deactivate



if database did show the connection result error or didn't show the record into browser then use below commands:
pip uninstall mysql-connector
pip uninstall mysql-connector-python
pip install mysql-connector-python
